# Hydra Cryptocurrency

Hydra is a cryptocurrency that is created to be easy to understand and green energy friendly. It is open source and with intuitive useability of the nodes, wallets and mining. Its approach is to mine only useful data (transaction validation) instead of wasting energy and computing power on solving complex math problems.

## Codebase

There is tree main components of the codebase:

- Hydra Blockchain
- Hydra Wallet
- Hydra Miner

In the following sections, we will explain each of them.

### Hydra Blockchain

The blockchain is the core of the Hydra cryptocurrency. It is responsible for storing all the transactions and blocks. The blockchain is a decentralized database that is managed by a network of nodes. The blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. The blockchain is immutable, meaning that once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed. In the block is registered its number, the timestamp, the hash of the previous block, the hash of the current block, and the list of transactions.

Each transaction is a transfer of Hydra coins from one wallet to another. The transaction contains the sender's wallet address, the receiver's wallet address, the amount of coins transferred, and a signature. The signature is used to verify that the transaction was created by the owner of the wallet.

### Hydra Wallet

The wallet is a software application that allows users to send and receive Hydra coins. The wallet is responsible for generating wallet addresses, creating transactions, and signing transactions. The wallet is also responsible for storing the user's private key, which is used to sign transactions. The signature is created by encrypting the transaction data with the sender's private key.

### Hydra Miner

The miner is a software application that is responsible for creating new blocks in the blockchain. The miner is responsible for verifying transactions, creating new blocks, and adding them to the blockchain. Instead of solving complex math problems, the miner is rewarded for keeping its node online and processing transactions. The miner is rewarded with a fluid amount of Hydra coins for each block it creates. The amount of coins rewarded is determined by the demand of transactions waiting to be processed.
